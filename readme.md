FOSFRA is a system capable of authentication with data privacy in mind, developed for synchronous online learning sessions. The project was developed as part of the IEEE Student Challenge organized by the IEEE P.2834 Standard for secure and trusted learning systems. 

The project is capable of performing the following tasks
-   Authentication using Facial recognition with the help of an Autonecoder based CNN model.
-   Online Learning for dynamically updating the CNN model.
-   Federated learning scheme to ensure data privacy.
-   Focus and attention estimation using Gaze estimation and blink rate analysis.
